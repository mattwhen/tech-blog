# Tech-Blog

## Description
Developers love sharing ideas about what they're building, explaining technical concepts, or seeking help from the developer community.

This CMS-style application is built for developers to be able to share their ideas by creating their own blog posts, being able to comment on other user blog posts, but also comment on their own posts to reply to a user. 

## Technologies used
* Handlebars.js as the templating language
* Sequelize as the ORM
* express-session npm package for user authentication


## Installation
The following applications should be installed onto the user's machine first, for this project to work correctly.

```
VS Code (or similar IDE)
Node.js
Node Package Manager (NPM) 
```
Once you have the above applications installed, you can clone the repo to your local machine from my GitHub: https://github.com/mattwhen/tech-blog <br> <br>

We'll need to download our modules/dependencies needed to run this application. In your terminal, cd into the Develop folder and then use the following command in your terminal: <br><br>

```
npm install
```

## How to use


## Challenges
One of the challenges I came across was 

## Future features
One feature I would add is adding functionality to reply individually to a user's comment. Another is adding 'like' and 'dislike' buttons to user's comments/posts. Finally, is adding notifications for a user whenever someone likes/dislikes their posts or if someone mentions them in a comment of some sort.
